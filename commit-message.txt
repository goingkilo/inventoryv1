DONE:
removed all except two methods in resource
only two default get,post methods, lends to easy reverse-proxying
used absolute paths in home.ftl instead of ../../../

TODO:
search returns only 10 results - this is a 'feature' .implement our own db search
product button should load home page
search opens up to autocomplete options
need to separate out db and provider, then introduce redis on top of provider
search results need to be stored in format search-term:[id,id,id]
need to sort products by price or brand or whateva
pagination
send emails
